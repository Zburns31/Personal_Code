2. Financial Statement Scraper: Scrape company financial reports to help retreieve additional information needed to build the fiancial analysis
3. DCF and Comparables Analysis: The tool will output a DCF and comparables analysis to give the user a range of potential values and financial metrics for the company
4. Sentiment Analyzer: The tool will compile a variety of news sources to give a rough understanding of what is going on with the company in the news

## Webscraper:
The web scraper collects financial data from Yahoo Finance such as: Current Price, Price History, Beta and other financial metrics. While we we attempt to calculate our own inputs where needed (Beta, cost of equity, cost of debt), it will be interesting to see how the tool's output differs from publicly available information
